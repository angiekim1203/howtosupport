### Support Champions
Support champions are typically divided into three categories: Enchanters, Pokes, and Tanks.
> [List of Support Champions](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Support_champion)

#### Enchanters
> Enchanters are AP-based champions that typically have skills that are able to **assist** their team, including shields, heals, and CCs. Auto ranges of Enchanters typically exceed 450 range.

#### Pokes
> Pokes typically assist through dealing **damage** to the other team's champions, typically purchasing damage items as a result. Skill ranges of Pokes typically exceed 800 range.

#### Tanks
> Tanks typically have a large focus on **tank** stats (Armor, Magic Armor, and Health), their skills also being oriented around self-shield or CCs. Auto ranges of Tanks typically are under 250 range.

### Support Starting Items
You are able to choose between two kinds of support items at the beginning, each kind having one for AP-based damage and AD-based damage. **All support items only stack up to 1,000 gold.**

#### Spelltheif's Edge (AP) / Spectral Sickle (AD)
> These allow you to earn 20 gold every time you **damage an enemy champion**. This effect stacks up to 3 times.
> Damage-based support items are most often used by enchanters and poke-based champions (long-range).

#### Relic Shield (AP) / Steel Shoulderguards (AD)
> These allow you to **execute minions**, earning gold according to the cost of the minion executed. This effect stacks up to 3 times.
> Minion-based support items are most often used by tanks (short-range).

### Support Items
As supports earn gold throughout the game, they tend to purchase items that are indicated for their purchase, typically being cheaper than other items.

#### Enchanter Items
> Enchanter items typically consist of abilities that are able to amplify or boost the damage of the team's champions alongside strengthening the power of their shields and healing.
> 
> **Example**: "Staff of Flowing Water" grants the owner of the item AP stats and shield/healing amplification. When a shield or heal is casted on an ally champion, the ally champion and the caster both obtain extra AP and Ability Haste.

#### Poke Items
> Poke items are  the items that the DPS would purchase, typically being more expensive than the support items. They are not listed in the link above.
>
> **Example**: "Luden's Tempest" grants the owner large amounts of AP stats while granting extra damage passives for an attack, the cooldown being 10 seconds each time.

#### Tank Items
> Tank items grant the owner abilities to either tank more damage or to protect allied champions alongside granting tank stats.
>
> **Example**: "Locket of the Iron Solari" grants nearby allies damage reduction, and when casted, it grants a shield to these nearby allies.

### Wards
When support starting items are upgraded, they allow you to store up to four wards. These wards, when placed in game, grant vision even without a champion being in the area. One of the main roles of a support is to maintain vision throughout the map.
