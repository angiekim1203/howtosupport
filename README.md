Support champions are typically divided into three categories: Enchanters, Pokes, and Tanks.

#### Enchanters
> Enchanters typically have skills that are able to assist their team, including shields, heals, and CCs. Auto ranges of Enchanters typically exceed 450 range.

#### Pokes
> Pokes typically assist through dealing damage to the other team's champions, typically purchasing damage items as a result. Skill ranges of Pokes typically exceed 800 range.

#### Tanks
> Tanks typically have large focus in tank stats (Armor, Magic Armor, and Health), their skills also being oriented around self-shield or CCs. Auto ranges of Tanks typically are under 250 range.


### Support Starting Items
You are able to choose between two kinds of support items at the beginning, each kind having one for AP-based damage and AD-based damage. **All support items only stack upto 1,000 gold.**

#### Spelltheif's Edge (AP) / Spectral Sickle (AD)
> These allow you to earn 20 gold every time you damage an enemy champion. This effect stacks upto 3 times.
> Damage-based support items are most often used by enchanters and poke-based champions (long-range).
